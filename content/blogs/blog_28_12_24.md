Building projects has always been a passion of mine, especially when AI is involved. When I embark on creating something, my approach is a blend of research, problem-solving, and leveraging tools like AI to streamline the development process. Here's how I typically go about building projects, especially in the realm of AI.

### Research and Roadmap Creation

Before diving into coding, I always start with research. Since many of the technologies I work with are new to me, this phase is crucial for laying down a solid foundation. I spend a fair amount of time exploring the specific tools, libraries, and techniques I’ll need to complete the project. Whether it’s learning about a new framework or understanding a concept that’s fundamental to the task at hand, this research helps me visualize how I want the project to unfold.

Once I have a general understanding, I create a roadmap. The roadmap serves as my guide throughout the entire project, breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Each task is like a puzzle piece, and by putting them together, I can gradually build the final product.

### Breaking Down the Project into Fragments

I don’t try to tackle the entire project at once. Instead, I break it down into individual problems or smaller fragments. By doing this, I focus on solving one problem at a time. This approach makes the project feel less overwhelming and allows me to dive deeper into each problem without getting distracted by the bigger picture.

### Problem-Solving with Code and AI Tools

Once I’ve identified the individual problems, it’s time to write the code. This is where I start the real work. However, coding isn’t always straightforward. Sometimes I run into challenges or need to optimize my code. In these instances, I turn to AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude for assistance.

These AI models are incredibly useful for generating code snippets, fixing bugs, or even providing suggestions when I’m stuck. But one thing to keep in mind the code tools like chatgpt generates is not always perfect and ready to copy-past in to the main project. I have to fix things here and there to make code useable.

### Refining the Code

Once I have a rough but functional version of my code, I don’t stop there. I believe in the importance of clean, well-structured code, so I take the time to refactor and improve it. Sometimes I handle this myself, but other times, I rely on ChatGPT or Claude to help me with code formatting and optimization. As mentioned before, Ai tools are not perfect most of the time I do the final touch up. 

### The Workflow in a Nutshell

To summarize, my approach to building projects is a cyclical process of research, problem breakdown, coding, and refinement. AI tools play a vital role in this workflow, making the process faster and more efficient. With each project, I learn new things, improve my skills, and grow as a developer.

This approach has worked wonders for me, and I hope it can help others looking to build projects in the AI space or any other field. Even this blog is also written by AI— I gave it all the context, a basic summary, and a few key points, and it generated a blog for me.
